        <h2>Chapter 1: My Introduction</h2>

        <p class="intro">
            My name is Colton, and I currently live in Minnesota. I have a deep passion for software development and enjoy working on coding projects. 
            In my free time, I like spending time with my son and playing video games.
        </p>

        <p>
            I grew up in a small town and developed an interest in technology at an early age. 
            Over the years, I have worked on various projects that have helped me refine my programming skills. 
            <span class="sentence">My goal is to become a lead software engineer and mentor others in the field.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            Apart from coding, I love traveling and exploring different cultures. 
            One of my most memorable trips was to Japan, where I visited Okinawa, Hokkaido, and Tokyo. 
            The experience was truly eye-opening, and I hope to travel more in the future.
        </p>

        <p>
            Family is very important to me. I am a single parent raising my son, and I strive to provide the best life for him. 
            Balancing school, work, and family can be challenging, but it is rewarding. 
            I am excited about the journey ahead and the opportunities in the IT field.
